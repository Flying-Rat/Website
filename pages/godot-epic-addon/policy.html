          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>We respect your privacy and have kept this policy very simple. Unlike larger services (for example, Epic Games) that collect and use extensive player data, our game does not gather any personal information about you. We do not ask for names, emails, payment details, or any other personal identifiers. In fact, because we collect no personal data at all, we are not subject to specific privacy laws like the GDPR or CCPA. We still follow good privacy practices, but no user data ever leaves your device unless you choose to send it to us.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5">
          <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
          <p>We collect none of the following information in this game:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal identifiers:</strong> No names, emails, usernames, addresses, social media handles, or similar personal details. (We don't even require an account.)</li>
            <li><strong>Payment/Financial data:</strong> No credit card, billing info, or purchase records. We do not process payments at all.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical identifiers:</strong> We do not log your IP address, location, device ID, or other hardware identifiers.</li>
            <li><strong>Gameplay/Usage data:</strong> We do not track or record your gameplay habits or app usage. There are no analytics or telemetry tied to you. In short, no usage logs are collected or stored.</li>
            <li><strong>Any sensitive or personal data:</strong> We do not obtain sensitive info (like health, race, or precise location), and we do not track cookies or advertising IDs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In summary, the game collects nothing you wouldn't expect and specifically none of the categories listed above. Everything you do in the game stays private to you.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5">
          <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>Because we collect no personal information, we have nothing to use for marketing or personalization. We do not send promotional emails or show you targeted ads. We do not share or combine your data in any way. The game only uses the bare minimum of non-identifying data needed for basic functionality (for example, saving your game progress on your device). If a crash occurs, an anonymous log may be created on your device to help us fix bugs, but it contains no personal data.</p>
          <p>To illustrate the contrast: Epic Games' policy lists many ways they use player data to improve and customize services. In our case, because we have no personal data, none of those uses apply. We do not customize the experience based on you, and we do not analyze or sell your information. Any purely technical information (like error reports or generic game stats) remains anonymous and is used only to improve the game's performance.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5">
          <h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>
          <p>We do not share your information with any third parties. We do not sell or rent your data, because we don't have any personal data to sell. There are no advertising networks, analytics providers, or other third-party services embedded in the game that receive your personal data. All data generated by the game stays within the game or on your device. In other words: we do not transfer or disclose any user information to outside parties. As one example, 8th Day Gym states "We do not sell or share personal information with third parties" â€“ the same is true for our game.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5">
          <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>Our game is suitable for players of all ages, and we take children's privacy seriously. Because we do not collect any personal information, children under 13 (or under 16, depending on local laws) can play safely without providing any data. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, and we do not ask for any personal details at all. (For example, My Town Games explicitly states "We do not collect any personal information from children with our apps".) If a child were to inadvertently send us personal information (for example, by contacting support), we would delete it immediately.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5">
          <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as needed. If we do, we will post the new version on this page and update the "Last Updated" date so you can see what changed. For example, Pew Research Center notes they will "revise the 'Effective Date' and post the new Privacy Policy" when changes occur. Similarly, we will revise this policy and notify you of the change here. If we make significant changes, we will try to notify players (for example, via an in-game notice). Your continued use of the game after a change means you accept the updated policy. We recommend checking back occasionally for the latest information.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5">
          <h2>Contact Information</h2>
          <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@flying-rat.studio">hello@flying-rat.studio</a> (or through our support page). For example, Epic's policy advises users to email privacy@epicgames.com with privacy questions. In the same way, you can reach our team by email. We will do our best to respond promptly to any privacy-related inquiries.</p>

          <h2>Sources</h2>
          <p>We based this policy on standard practices and examples from the Epic Games Store privacy policy and other app developers' policies, but in plain language and reflecting the fact that this game does not handle personal data.</p>
