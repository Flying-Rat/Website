          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>We respect your privacy and have kept this policy very simple. Unlike larger services that collect and use extensive player data, our game does not gather any personal information about you. We do not ask for names, emails, payment details, or any other personal identifiers. In fact, because we collect no personal data at all, we are not subject to specific privacy laws like the GDPR or CCPA. We still follow good privacy practices, but no user data ever leaves your device unless you choose to send it to us.</p>

          <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
          <p>We collect none of the following information in this game:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal identifiers:</strong> No names, emails, usernames, addresses, social media handles, or similar personal details. (We don't even require an account.)</li>
            <li><strong>Payment/Financial data:</strong> No credit card, billing info, or purchase records. We do not process payments at all.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical identifiers:</strong> We do not log your IP address, location, device ID, or other hardware identifiers.</li>
            <li><strong>Gameplay/Usage data:</strong> We do not track or record your gameplay habits or app usage. There are no analytics or telemetry tied to you. In short, no usage logs are collected or stored.</li>
            <li><strong>Any sensitive or personal data:</strong> We do not obtain sensitive info (like health, race, or precise location), and we do not track cookies or advertising IDs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In summary, the game collects nothing you wouldn't expect and specifically none of the categories listed above. Everything you do in the game stays private to you.</p>

          <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>Because we collect no personal information, we have nothing to use for marketing or personalization. We do not send promotional emails or show you targeted ads. We do not share or combine your data in any way. The game only uses the bare minimum of non-identifying data needed for basic functionality (for example, saving your game progress on your device). If a crash occurs, an anonymous log may be created on your device to help us fix bugs, but it contains no personal data.</p>
